So as a follow-up, it appears there are already at least 2 posts on R Bloggers about Wordle, 
but I'm going to save the links for now and not look at them 'til I've taken a crack at it.

words we've seen
cloud
wrung 

both 'low scores' as far as matching other things

Google book ngrams

ADD
Weight different positions differently (like starting letters more important
than ending)
